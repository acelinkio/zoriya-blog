For [Kyoo](https://github.com/zoriya/kyoo), I need to play video on a variety of clients (browsers, TVs, mobile apps). Clients does not always support the video codec of the source video since videos are user provided. Any valid video should work everywhere. Users should not have to worry about converting videos for Kyoo to work, everything should Workâ„¢ the first time.

Users don't always have a stable connection, but they should be able to play their video, even if they are on a train. Those constraints mean that Kyoo needs a service to change videos codec and file size (transcode) on the fly. Why on the fly? Because we don't want users to store all their videos 5 times (the original, a 480p version, a 720p version and so on).

## The goal

To put the goal list into text we want a service capable of:
 - Streaming a video file
 - Allow users to select the video quality
 - Allow clients to automatically select the best video quality it can play (and auto-switch when internet speed changes)
 - Prefer the original video if it can be played by the device/connection speed

The last point is particularly important since Kyoo is self-hosted and user's servers are not always powerful enough to always transcode video.

As for any video services, the following points should also be satisfied:
 - Start playing fast (we don't want to wait 30s to start watching a movie)
 - Allow users to seek anywhere on the media at any point

## The constraints

To allow clients to change quality when the connection's speed changes, two standards exist. HLS and Dash. Both are widely supported and offer the same benefits and constraints. I used HLS, but I believe the two could be used interchangeably without too much issue.

I'm going to give you a brief overview of what HLS looks like. It consists of 3 types of files:

 - Segments, small chunks (should be between 2s and 10s) of video or audio (in a .ts or .mp4 container).
 - Index/segments playlist (.m3u8), a file listing every segments' URL and their length.
 - Master playlists (.m3u8) that contains the list of variants (720p, 1080p, 4k...).

```

Now that we know what we want, let's talk about how we could proceed.

## Initial idea 

When I think of videos, my first thought initially goes to ffmpeg. As always, ffmpeg does support HLS with the following command:

```bash
ffmpeg -i in.mkv -f hls ...
```

But this approach has a few caveats. The most important one is the time it takes. This command will produce HLS segments one at a time starting from the first. Streaming this file will show users a video of 30s growing untill the command has finished.

The user can't seek past the transcoded end
 If we want to quality switches, we need a command like this:

```bash
ffmpeg -map
```

This command will eagerly transcode the video in all qualities ; killing the server's performances while doing so.

## Wrap ffmpeg

// rust approach: ffmpeg process for each quality on demand => changing qualify restarted the stream at the beginning.

## The bugs of ffmpeg

## Don't be afraid of failures

I wrote the transcoder in C, rewrote it in rust and finally rewrote it again in golang.
