This are my thoughts about nix, a tool I use & love, that I don't recommend.


doc

## What is nix

#### Package manager

more packets than everything blabla

lack of versioned thing (hint abour flakes as a okish solution)

#### OS

#### DSL

### lack of docs, weird state of flakes

## Project tools

### Dotenv

#### goswag, prisma etc

### Unified commands

### Docker

### CI

## System configuration

### Flakes

### Temporary config

(you just need to find a machine with nix to use it)

### Modules & Debug

### Impermanence

## Conclusion
