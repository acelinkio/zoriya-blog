I work on [Kyoo](https://github.com/zoriya/kyoo) or other nerdy projects at night. I love weird tools ([keyboard](https://github.com/zoriya/abyss) that I designed myself, [vim](./blogs/vim-superpowers/), tiling window manager like [dwl](https://codeberg.org/dwl/dwl) or [gaze](https://github.com/zoriya/gaze)). Feel free to reach out if you want to talk!
